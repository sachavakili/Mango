# Question Answering NLP with character-level RNN

The different models will first be challenged with the bAbI dataset from FAIR and the SQuAD dataset from Stanford.


### Usage (on bAbI dataset):

Query-Reduction Network with Char2Word:
```bash
python char2word_qrn.py
```

Query-Reduction Network without Char2Word:
```bash
python qrn.py
```

EntNet:
will be soon here ...

### Usage (on SQuAD dataset):

Query-Reduction Network with Char2Word:
```bash
python mango_squad.py
```
